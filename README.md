This code is a TradingView script that uses the Pine programming language to plot the moon phases on the price chart based on UTC time. 

It uses the built-in ta.moonphase() function to get the moon phase data and the plotchar() function to draw the symbols. 

The indicator can be used for visualizing the lunar cycles and their possible effects on the market
